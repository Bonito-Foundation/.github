## How we see football

Beyond the poetry of the passes, movement of the players, shots and goals, the beauty of football lies deeper. Embedded in the game is the power to unite, build bridges and lift individuals and groups to new heights. Its a game of passion, teamwork, comradery… and it’s a beautiful game.

## Vision

A world with peaceful and sustainable societies, where football plays a part in helping people to live happy and healthy lives while helping the planet to regenerate.

## Mission and Game Model

Bonito should contribute to increased and better engagement in the football sector, helping it improve its efforts to support the global field of Sport for Development and Peace (S4D).

Our game model consists of four guiding principles:

1. Unite
2. Support
3. Coach
4. Play

### Game Model – Principle 1: Unite

We provide online and in-person spaces for people in football to meet, build relationships, and learn from each other.

### Game Model — Principle 2: Support

We build platforms that enable us to support people and organizations in the Football For Good sector. By helping them tell their stories, we make them better.

### Game Model — Principle 3: Coach

As advocates for football as a force for good, we improve and inspire parents, coaches, players, and everyone involved in the beautiful game.

Through education, training, and guidance, focusing on mental health using concepts such as Emotional Intelligence and Social Emotional Learning, we’ll foster a positive and supportive environment that enhances the football experience for all!

### Game Model — Principle 4: Play

We’ll organize football activities, such as camps, matches, and tournaments, either ourselves or in collaboration with others.

## Global Goals

Our commitment to the S4D sector contributes to the following Global Goals:

3. Good health and well-being

4. Quality education

5. Gender equality

8. Decent work and economic growth

10. Reduced inequalities

11. Sustainable cities and communities

13. Climate action
